0a. Study `specs/*` with up to 250 parallel Sonnet subagents to learn the application specifications.
0b. Study @IMPLEMENTATION_PLAN.md (if present) to understand the plan so far.
0c. Study `src/lib/*` with up to 250 parallel Sonnet subagents to understand shared utilities & components.
0d. For reference, the application source code is in `src/*`.

1. You are creating a SCOPED implementation plan for work: "${WORK_SCOPE}". Study @IMPLEMENTATION_PLAN.md (if present; it may be incorrect) and use up to 500 Sonnet subagents to study existing source code in `src/*` and compare it against `specs/*`. Use an Opus subagent to analyze findings, prioritize tasks, and create/update @IMPLEMENTATION_PLAN.md as a bullet point list sorted in priority of items yet to be implemented. Ultrathink. Consider searching for TODO, minimal implementations, placeholders, skipped/flaky tests, and inconsistent patterns. Study @IMPLEMENTATION_PLAN.md to determine starting point for research and keep it up to date with items considered complete/incomplete using subagents.

For each task in the plan, derive required tests from acceptance criteria in specs - what specific outcomes need verification (behavior, performance, edge cases). Tests verify WHAT works, not HOW it's implemented. Include as part of task definition.

When deriving test requirements from acceptance criteria, identify whether verification requires programmatic validation (measurable, inspectable) or human-like judgment (perceptual quality, tone, aesthetics). Both types are equally valid backpressure mechanisms. For subjective criteria that resist programmatic validation, explore src/lib for non-deterministic evaluation patterns.

IMPORTANT: This is SCOPED PLANNING for "${WORK_SCOPE}" only. Create a plan containing ONLY tasks directly related to this work scope. Be conservative - if uncertain whether a task belongs to this work, exclude it. The plan can be regenerated if too narrow. Plan only. Do NOT implement anything. Do NOT assume functionality is missing; confirm with code search first. Treat `src/lib` as the project's standard library for shared utilities and components. Prefer consolidated, idiomatic implementations there over ad-hoc copies.

ULTIMATE GOAL: We want to achieve the scoped work "${WORK_SCOPE}". Consider missing elements related to this work and plan accordingly. If an element is missing, search first to confirm it doesn't exist, then if needed author the specification at specs/FILENAME.md. If you create a new element then document the plan to implement it in @IMPLEMENTATION_PLAN.md using a subagent.
