# Progress Log

This file tracks learnings, patterns, and discoveries across Ralph Wiggum iterations.
Entries are append-only - never delete, only add.

[2026-01-15] Project Initialized
- Pattern: Created complete Ralph Wiggum documentation suite
- Tip: Start with AUDIENCE_JTBD.md to ground all specs in user needs
- Tip: Use SLC releases to ship value incrementally

[2026-01-15] Agent Installation Feature Set Complete
- Pattern: Most features in Releases 1-3 were already implemented, needed systematic verification
- Pattern: Agent installation follows the established WebSocket message pattern: add type, handler, state, UI
- Gotcha: The dashboard's npm run typecheck script doesn't exist - use `npx tsc --noEmit` instead
- Gotcha: Pre-existing lint errors in the codebase (unused vars, case block declarations) - not blockers
- Tip: YAML frontmatter in agent .md files enables name/description parsing for the UI
- Tip: No git remote configured - push will need `git remote add origin <url>` first
